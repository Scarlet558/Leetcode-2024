"""
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.



Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
"""
"""
Key Insight:

Use two-pointer technique to swap characters from start and end, moving inwards
In-place reversal means no extra space needed

Core Steps:

Two pointers: start (0) and end (length-1)
While start < end:

Swap characters at start and end
Move start forward, end backward

        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.

        start = 0
